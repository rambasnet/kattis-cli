### Create and activate virtual environment using conda

- follow the instruction provided in the link to create and activate virtual environment:
[https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#activating-an-environment](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#activating-an-environment)

### Test a solution locally

- currently the following languages have been tested: Python 3, C++, NodeJS, C, Java
- make sure CLI compilers are in your PATH
- make sure python3 files have first line shebang: !/usr/bin/env python3
    - or have extensions .py3
- update the **.kattis-cli.toml** file in your home directory to add more languages
- see [kattis_cli/.kattis-cli.toml](https://github.com/rambasnet/kattis-cli/blob/main/kattis_cli/.kattis-cli.toml) file for example.

```bash
cd <problem_id>
kattis test
```

![Test](images/test.png)

### Submit a problem
